And thus...science was done.

The $PtSn_4$ sample has been recleaved and inserted back into the STM along with a new $W$ tip. We hope to discern if the rotating defects arise in the same density as well as any additional defects that may arise. With this knowledge of defects and terminations we hope to perform detailed grid maps over more defects with a fresh tip.

We will be performing z callibration because I have no idea what the frickity frackin fuck I'm looking at and I'm V ANNOYED.
