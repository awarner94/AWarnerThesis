	journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
	abstract = {In the first three years since the discovery of Fe-based high Tc superconductors, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy have shed light on three important questions. First, STM has demonstrated the complexity of the pairing symmetry in Fe-based materials. Phase-sensitive quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging and low temperature spectroscopy have shown that the pairing order parameter varies from nodal to nodeless sÂ± within a single family, FeTe1âˆ’xSex. Second, STM has imaged C4 â†’ C2 symmetry breaking in the electronic states of both parent and superconducting materials. As a local probe, STM is in a strong position to understand the interactions between these broken symmetry states and superconductivity. Finally, STM has been used to image the vortex state, giving insights into the technical problem of vortex pinning, and the fundamental problem of the competing states introduced when superconductivity is locally quenched by a magnetic field. Here we give a pedagogical introduction to STM and QPI imaging, discuss the specific challenges associated with extracting bulk properties from the study of surfaces, and report on progress made in understanding Fe-based superconductors using STM techniques.}

	title = {The giant planar Hall effect and anisotropic magnetoresistance in Dirac node arcs semimetal {PtSn}4},
	journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
	abstract = {Topological semimetals (TSMs) present intriguing quantum states and have attracted much attention in recent years because of exhibiting various anomalous magneto-transport phenomena. Theoretical prediction shows that some novel phenomena, such as negative magnetoresistance (MR) and the planar Hall effect (PHE), originate from the chiral anomaly in TSMs. In this work, high-field (33 T) Shubnikovâ€“de Haas (SdH) oscillations are obtained to reveal the topology of PtSn4. Giant PHE and anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) are observed in Dirac node arcs of semimetal PtSn4. First, a non-zero transverse voltage can be acquired while tilting the in-plane magnetic field. Moreover, the amplitude of PHE sharply increases at T* âˆ¼ 50 K with decreasing temperature, which is suggested to be related to the Fermi surface reconstruction observed in PtSn4. Subsequently, the field-dependent amplitudes of the PHE show an abnormal behavior around 50 K, which is thought to stem from the complex correlation between the chiral charge and electric one in PtSn4 driving the system into different coupling states due to the complicated band structure. On the other hand, the relative AMR is negative and up to âˆ’98% at 8.5 T. Our work proves that the PHE measurements are a convincing transport fingerprint feature to confirm the chiral anomaly in TSMs.}
